description: Create full-stack javascript applications within seconds 
---

Create full-stack javascript applications within seconds using *npx* to generate your project files from the latest template.

Replace project-name with your project name and run the command below to start a project: 

```sh
npx create-nullstack-app project-name
```

Change directory to the generated folder:

```sh
cd app-name
```

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Start the application in development mode:

```sh
npm start
```

## Understanding the generated files

The following folders and files will be generated:

### index.js

This is the webpack entry point.

Usually, you don't have to touch this file, but it is a convenient place to import global dependencies like CSS frameworks.

### src/

This folder will contain the actual source code of your application.

### src/Application.njs

This is your application main file.

>âœ¨ Learn more about the [njs file extension](/njs-file-extension "Nullstack Javascript").

The start function will be automatically called once when you run *npm start*, use it to populate your server [context](/context-and-attributes) with things like [database](/database-example), [settings](/context-settings), and [secrets](/context-secrets).

>âœ¨ Learn more about the [application startup](/application-startup).

### src/Application.scss

This is an empty file just to demonstrate that you can use [SCSS with nullstack](/styles).

It is a good practice to import a style file in a component with the same name.

>âœ¨ Learn more about [styles](/styles).

### public/

Every file in here will be available to anyone from the domain root.

By default *create-nullstack-app* generates the icons required for your manifest.json and images for OG meta tags.

>âœ¨ Learn more about [manifest.json](/manifest-json).

Be sure to replace these images with your project identity.

### .development/

This is the compiled result of your application in development mode.

> ðŸ”¥ Do not touch this folder

### .production/

This is the compiled result of your application in production mode.

> ðŸ”¥ Do not touch this folder
