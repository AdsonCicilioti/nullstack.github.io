TODO:
- present in the global client context
- has every query string param mapped to a key
- every key value is a string
- except for true/false which become booleans
- by default every key responds as an empty string instead of undefined
- dynamic segments from the route attribute are injected in the local context
- assigning to the params will update the query string in the url
- changes in the params will cause a history push event
- params cannot be assigned in the lifecycle inside the server yet*
- params changes are debounced
- params with dynamic segments cascade to children 
- assignments are serialized to json
