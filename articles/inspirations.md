TODO:
- demo version was written in react and was a disaster (but its my fault)
- dependency injection based on ember.js <3
- developer happyness over performance comes from ruby (but in the end performance was good)
- autistic line of thought
- overspliting makes harder to get back to projects after a while
- frameworks tend to split code by type and not tasks
- fullstack developers dont normally have overview of the app behviour
- its hard to reuse code that separates front from back end
- microservices tend to be missused because its anoying to make backend for them
- big chunks of any application are glue code
- dont wanna be locked into an folder structure for every type of project
- moving code structure/refactoring is a pain in tree based states
- you dont always know the full scope of an application. solve parts of the puzzle at a time
- frameworks tend to have mannerisms nullstack is as vanilla as possible
- no compromises, nullstack is not for everyone its for me and people like me
- frameworks change to much and in the end always lose to the vanilla implementation
- no hipster bullshit, its meant to work, not to shame developers
- because i wanted to create it
- other frameworks are afraid of promises
